# Socket-IO

Socket.io is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have nearly identical APIs.

### How Does It Work?

Socket.io primarily uses the WebSocket protocol but can fallback to other methods if WebSocket is not available or if there are networking issues such as firewalls and proxy servers. It abstracts all these fallback mechanisms and provides a simple API to work with, regardless of the transport layer.

### What Can It Be Used For?

Socket.io is commonly used in:

- Real-time chat applications
- Collaboration tools
- Online gaming
- Real-time analytics
- Live updates for sports scores, stocks, or other rapidly-changing data


## Example:

Here's a brief example to illustrate how Socket.io could work for real-time communication:

### How to Run

```sh
# Install dependencies
node i

# Run the server
node server.js
```

Access the Client: 
- Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:4000
